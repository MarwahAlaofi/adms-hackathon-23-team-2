As an Activist Egalitarian, how am I likely to vote on the Voice to Parliament?","As an Activist Egalitarian, you are likely to support the Voice to Parliament, as it aligns with your values of social justice, equity and public investment1. You may see the Voice as a way to empower Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples and address the historical and ongoing injustices they face2.

However, you may also have some reservations or questions about the details of the proposal, such as how the Voice would be elected, funded and accountable, and what kind of influence it would have on government decisions3. You may also be concerned about the potential backlash or resistance from some segments of society, such as conservative politicians, media outlets and think tanks, who oppose the Voice as divisive, unnecessary or undemocratic4.

You may want to learn more about the Voice by listening to the views and experiences of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people themselves, especially those who live in your area or share your background. You may also want to engage with other Activist Egalitarians who support the Voice and join their campaigns or events5.
